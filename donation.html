                <h5>CompTIA</h5>
                <p>
                    CompTIA A+ is widely considered one of the top certificates for a well-rounded entry-level
                    introduction to IT. Those who pass the certification exams will be qualified to solve basic issues in
                    networking, operating systems, security, and mobile devices. The CompTIA A+ provides a general
                    introduction to the IT world. From there, many IT professionals can go on to specialise in a specific
                    field of IT, like networks, security, or cloud computing, either by building experience or gaining
                    relevant certifications.
                    Cost: about ₹20,366.46 per exam ($246 USD)
                    Potential jobs: Service desk analyst, technical support specialist, associate network engineer, desktop
                    support administrator, system support specialist
                    Requirements: Two certification exams are required. There are no prerequisites to the exams, but
                    CompTIA recommends having 9 to 12 months of hands-on experience.
                    Certification path: After the CompTIA A+, candidates can go on to take other CompTIA certifications,
                    like Security+ or Network+, or certifications from other providers like the CCNA.

            <li>
                <h5>Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)</h5>
                <p>
                    The CCNA certification is an associate-level certification that covers the fundamentals of IT
                    networking issues. This includes network access, IP connectivity, and IP services. Though it’s not a
                    vendor-neutral certification—meaning it’ll test you exclusively on Cisco products and tools—it’s
                    popular amongst network professionals because of Cisco’s dominance in the networking market. One
                    exam is required to get the CCNA certification.
                    Cost: about ₹24,500 ($300USD)
                    Potential jobs: Network specialist, network administrator, systems administrator, network engineer
                    Requirements: One certification exam is required. There are no prerequisites to the exam, but Cisco
                    recommends having a year of training and experience with computer networks.
                    Certification path: After the CCNA, candidates can go on to take more advanced network
                    certifications, like the Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) or the Juniper Networks Certified
                    Associate - Junos (JNCIA-Junos).

                <h5>CompTIA Security+</h5>
                <p>
                    The CompTIA Security+ certification will equip you with the skills to perform basic security functions.
                    The certification will cover subjects like encryption, physical security, and wireless security. It requires
                    one exam. If you’re interested in becoming an IT security specialist, you can go on to take more
                    advanced security certifications like the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) or the advanced
                    Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).
                    Security is a growing field, employing 4.7 million people globally, according to the 2022 (ISC)2
                    cybersecurity Workforce Study. On top of this large global workforce, the study also identified a
                    "worldwide gap of 3.4 million cybersecurity workers" [2].
                    Cost: about ₹32,453 ($392 USD)
                    Potential jobs: Security administrator, security specialist, security consultant, security engineer,
                    network administrator, security analyst
                    Requirements: Requires one certification exam. There are no prerequisites, but CompTIA
                    recommends having the CompTIA Network+ certification and two years of experience in IT
                    administration.
                    Certification path: After the Security+, candidates can go on to take other security certifications like
                    the ISC2 Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP) or ISACA Certified Information Systems
                    Auditor (CISA).

                <h5>Microsoft Fundamentals+</h5>
                <p>
                    The Microsoft fundamentals certifications test core technology skills, making them good entry-level
                    qualifications for those who are expected to work with Microsoft products. Knowing your way
                    
                    around Microsoft products is likely to be an in-demand skill—over half of surveyed IT decision-
                    makers around the world said their companies would invest in Microsoft technology, Global

            <h5>Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Practitioner</h5>
            <p>
                Cloud computing, along with security, is one of the most in-demand fields in IT, and Amazon Web
                Services (AWS) is currently the most-used cloud platform in the world. So learning the AWS platform
                may give you an edge in this growing industry. The AWS Cloud Practitioner certification is the most
                entry-level of the AWS certifications.
                The AWS Cloud Practitioner certification is designed to help you gain foundational AWS knowledge
                and can be great for those just starting out in IT. However, many cloud-related jobs ask for an
                associate-level AWS certification, which is a level above the practitioner certification. If you already
                have a year of experience with AWS, the associate-level AWS Solutions Architect, SysOps
                Administrator, or Developer certifications might better prepare you for entry-level cloud computing
                jobs.
                Cost: about ₹8,200 ($100USD)
                Potential jobs: Cloud engineering intern, cloud developer, cloud engineer, cloud architect
                Requirements: There are no prerequisites to the exam, but Amazon recommends having at least a
                basic understanding of AWS services and uses and around six months of exposure to AWS.
                Certification path: After the AWS Cloud Practitioner, you can go on to get a more advanced
                certification like the AWS Certified Developer or AWS Certified Solutions Architect.

    <h5>CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+)</h5>
    <p>
        The ITF+ is a beginning-level certification designed for those who want to see if IT is the right career

        certification can help you decide. If you’re looking for a certification that will help you gain skills for a
        job in IT, other certifications like the CompTIA A+ might fit your needs better.
        Cost: about ₹11,093 ($134USD)

        those who are just starting out in networking or who find the CCNA too comprehensive for their
        current needs.
        Cost: about ₹29,638 ($358USD)
        Potential jobs: Network administrator, network engineer, system administrator
        Requirements: No formal requirements, but the CompTIA A+ and 9 to 12 months of experience with
        networks are recommended.

        the Network+.

                <p>
                  Cisco offers a range of certification programs designed to help IT professionals demonstrate their
                  skills and expertise in Cisco technologies. There are many CISCO certifications available, each with its
                  specific focus.
                  For example, the CCNA certification is designed for entry-level network technicians, while the CCNP
                  certification is geared toward more experienced network professionals. Some of the other CISCO
                  certifications include the CCIE, CCSP, and CCDP.
                  CISCO certifications are highly respected in the IT industry and can open up many career
                  opportunities. They are also a great way to keep your skills up-to-date and stay ahead of the curve in
                  an ever-changing field.

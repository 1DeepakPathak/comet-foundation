            As we visit to many schools, we find that one of the main issues is students' lack of knowledge regarding career preparation.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:larger; font-weight: 600; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
            Even though our career counselling sessions are helping the students in becoming more conscious of career development, but still there are gaps. While a small percentage of students are making career plans, most students are still not doing this. This inconsistency in career planning is the concern for school management. The second problem is that the school management is not able to track the inconsistency. Therefore, we want to help the school management in this regard by developing career planning tracker in web portal, which all student from class 8 and above will have to update following the completion of counselling session at school. 
        </p>
     <p style="font-size:larger; font-weight: 600; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        Once these details are updated by students from class 8 and above, we will share the reports with respective principal sir. Thus, we can guarantee that each student has a career plan in place.
